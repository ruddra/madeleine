Social networking based statistical data retriever. Using APIs from Twitter, Facebook and Google Plus, it will retreive user specific data like location and language(for now) and represent it in graphical format.

The bootstrap template which was used here is named fluffy, which is opensource.

This project has been developed using <a href="www.tornadoweb.org">tornado</a> and various pluggins.
